<p>Hibiscus herbal tea is more than just a delicious beverage. The health benefits of hibiscus tea are what make it so special. Hibiscus tea is made from the deep magenta sepals of the roselle flower, which is thought to be native to Africa. It is also known by its plant name Hibiscus sabdariffaâ€”hence the name hibiscus tea. The hibiscus name also comes from the Greek word hibiskos, and it is a flowering plant from the mallow family.</p>

<p>It is important to note that there are 232 species of hibiscus, and not all of them are used for tea or healing. For instance, the Hibiscus sabdariffa plant should not be confused with other hibiscus species such as the non-medicinal Hibiscus acetosella. The traditional hibiscus tea plant has yellow flowers and a red center. The Hibiscus acetosella has red flowers.</p>
