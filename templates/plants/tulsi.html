<p>What is Holy Basil (Tulsi)?<br>
Holy basil (Ocimum sanctum) or tulsi is a powerful herb that has been used in Ayurveda and other traditional medical treatments in India for thousands of years. The small holy basil shrub with tiny lavender flowers is considered a sacred plant in India and is often worshipped. It was believed that the holy basil leaves had potent powers to flush out toxins from the body. Even now in India, people have tulsi water (water which has tulsi leaves soaked overnight) or chew on a tulsi leaf to improve overall health. Several health products are available with tulsi extracts to help treat cold, cough, and the flu.</p>

<p>Holy basil is incredibly beneficial for human health, primarily due to the unique composition of its essential oil, containing eugenol, camphor, flavonoids, nerol, and various terpenes.This rich blend of organic compounds delivers a number of health benefits and can help relieve acne, asthma, inflammation, respiratory issues, and lower your chances of heart diseases and atherosclerosis.</p> 

<p>Holy basil differs from the basil used in Italian dishes or Thai basil used in curries in Southeast Asia. Holy basil or tulsi has a pungent and bitter taste and it is not usually used for cooking. It is however used to make tulsi tea which has adaptogenic properties. </p>
